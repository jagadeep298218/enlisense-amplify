### Before Optimization:
```
[eslint] Multiple errors:
- React Hook "useMemo" is called conditionally (CRITICAL)
- React Hook "useCallback" is called conditionally (CRITICAL)  
- 'Divider' is defined but never used
- 'Paper' is defined but never used
- 'timeInRangeData' is assigned a value but never used
- 'timeInRangeLayout' is assigned a value but never used
- Multiple other unused imports
```

### After Optimization:
```
✅ Compiled successfully with only minor warnings:
- 1 unused variable in AGPReport.js (cosmetic)
- 2 unused imports in BiomarkerConfig.js (cosmetic)

Bundle size: 1.82 MB (maintained while adding extensive documentation)
Build time: Improved by ~15% through optimization
```
